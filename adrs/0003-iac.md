## Context

We need to implement a repeatable and scalable infrastructure management approach for the new project. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has been identified as a crucial strategy to achieve this. After consideration, three primary options were evaluated: CDK, Cloud Formation, and Terraform. 

### Option 1: Use CDK

Pros:
- Deep integration with the cloud provider's services and features.
- Access to the latest services and features upon release through the low-level constructs.
- Supported by programming languages, enabling more complex logic and reuse of existing code.

Cons:
- Vendor lock-in, reducing flexibility in cloud provider choice.
- Learning curve and complexity can vary significantly between resources and theirs avaialbitily as L2/L3 Constructs.
- Can be challenging to manage and maintain due to the complexity of the codebase.

### Option 2: Use Terraform

Pros:
- **Clear syntax and developer-friendliness**: Terraform's HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) offers a human-readable code style, making it easier for developers to learn and use.
- **Provider agnostic**: Supports multiple providers, not just cloud, allowing for more flexible infrastructure management across different environments.
- **State management**: Tracks and manages the state of the infrastructure, facilitating easy updates and changes.

Cons:
- Delays in supporting the latest cloud provider features compared to native tools.
- Requires management of state files, which can introduce complexity in team environments.

### Option 3: Use CloudFormation

Pros:
- Deep integration with AWS services and features.
- Native support for AWS resources and configurations.

Cons:
- AWS-specific, leading to vendor lock-in.
- Hard to manage and maintain due to YAML/JSON syntax.

## Decision

The team has decided to adopt Terraform as the IaC tool for managing the project's infrastructure.

## Rationale

Terraform has been chosen due to its clear syntax, developer-friendly nature, and its ability to manage complex infrastructure setups in a consistent and predictable manner. The benefits of being provider agnostic and having a strong community support also played a significant role in this decision. While acknowledging the potential delays in feature support and the need to manage state files, the advantages of using Terraform align well with the project's goals for scalable, flexible, and efficient infrastructure management.

## Consequences

- All team members will need to familiarize themselves with Terraform and its best practices for IaC.
- The project will benefit from a more standardized and streamlined approach to infrastructure management, potentially reducing cloud costs and improving deployment times.
- Infrastructure changes will be documented as code in the project's repository, improving visibility, traceability, and version control.
- The team will need to implement strategies for state file management and sharing to ensure consistent application of infrastructure changes.
